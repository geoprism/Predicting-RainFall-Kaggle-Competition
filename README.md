# Predicting-RainFall-Kaggle-Competition


## Project Overview
This project consisted of building predictive models to analyze satellite-based measurements of clouds. Target values accurately predict the presence or absence of rainfall in a particular location. This data was made available from the UC Irvine Center of Hydrometeorology and contains a set of 14 features that include information such as cloud area, temperature, density, humidity, etc. The target y value is a binary indicator whether there is rain or no rain at a location. In order to accurately predict rainfall, I will be performing feature selection as well as utilizing different machine learning models such as knn, logistic regression, decision trees, etc. Lastly, I will build an ensemble (“blend” of predictors) and submit the final score to Kaggle.
